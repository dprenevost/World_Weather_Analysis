# World_Weather_Analysis
## Utilizing different public and semi public API's to gather:
* current weather data
  * create 'heat' maps based on temp, cloud cover, etc
  * display only the desired minimum and maximum temperatures asociated with a location
  
* location information based on lat, lng
  * city, country info
  * hotel and hospitality nearby

* directional driving directions to create itenerary
  * create a route highlited on the map between destinations
  * display city and hotel locations in 'popup' bubbles for ease of reading


#### Utilizing API keys and creating maps with detailed information using python was daunting at first, then once I realized this was just another data source with slightly different rules to apply it was not quite as intimidating.  Once I was able to gather and manage the data, it began to make more sense.
